# Lore Context 

The player enters a branching labyrinth where 8 sentries guard the possible exit paths. Each sentry is from [...]

Each one is capable of telling perfect truth OR perfect lies — but the player does not know which ahead of time.

To escape the labyrinth, the player must deduce correct reality from falsehood through questioning. 

Each correct deduction moves them deeper toward the exit. Each wrong deduction corrupts their mental map — and three mistakes trap them forever.

This game simulates the intuition behind P vs NP — determining valid truth requires search, inference, strategy, and bounded error tolerance. 

Logical reasoning becomes the only weapon the player has in this space.
